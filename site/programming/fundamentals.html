      <h2>Programming Fundamentals</h2>
      <p>This page lists fundamental programming skills needed to be a well-rounded programmer. Text after '$' is a command. Text in italics has been entered by a user.</p>
      <p>All exercises are entirely optional and some exercises are more difficult than others.</p>
      </br>
      <h3>Printing Text</h3>
      <p>Writing text to the screen lets us get output from a program, such as a value we've computed. For example:</p>
      <div class="code">
        <p>$ hello.py</br>Hello, World!</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints "Hello, World!" like the example above.</br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints today's date.
      </p>
      </br>
      <h3>Reading Arguments</h3>
      <p>Reading arguments lets a user hand parameters, options, and values to programs. Arguments are given when a program is first run, and they are accessible through something called the "argument vector" which is usually called "argv". Consider a program which transforms its first argument into uppercase:</p>
      <div class="code">
        <p>$ uppercase.py hello</br>HELLO</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints its first argument in uppercase.</br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints the sum of its arguments (assume they are all integers).
      </p>
      </br>
      <h3>Reading Input</h3>
      <p>Reading input lets a user interact with a program. Interaction is requested by the program, which usually waits until input is given by the user. Consider a program which greets a user by the name they enter:</p>
      <div class="code">
        <p>$ greet.py</br>Enter your name:</br><i>Murto</i></br>Hello, Murto!</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which greets a user like the example above.</br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which asks the user for a number and tells them if it is prime.</br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which asks the user for a number and tells them if it is a palindrome.</br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which asks the user for two numbers and prints the sum.
