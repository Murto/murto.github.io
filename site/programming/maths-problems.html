      <h2>Maths Problems</h2>
      <p>This page lists maths problems to help learn a programming language. Text after '$' is a command. Text in italics has been entered by a user.</p>
      <p>All exercises are entirely optional and some exercises are more difficult than others.</p>

      <h3>Prime Numbers</h3>
      <p>The primes are numbers which are only divisible by themselves and one. Primes have applications all across maths and computing, one of which is cryptography.</p>
      <p>Some basic properties of primes are:</p>
      <p>
        - They are only divisible by 1 or themselves (0 and 1 are not prime).<br>
        - Non-primes are divisible by some set of primes, called <i>prime factors</i>.<br>
        - The prime factors of a number are unique.<br>
        - Prime factors can occur more than once (e.g. 4 has 2 as a prime factor twice).

        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints out the first 10 primes (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, ...).</br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints out the first 100 primes.</br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints out whether a given number is prime or not (e.g. 13 as input gives "yes", 14 gives "no")<br>
        <b>Exercise:</b> write a program which prints out the unique prime factors of a given number (e.g. 16 as input gives "2", 36 gives "2 3")
